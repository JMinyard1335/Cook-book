For a crust without a crust cover use the single crust ingredients if making a crust with a top use the Double Crust

- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2/3 cup of shortening
- 4-5 Tbsp of cold water
**** Double crust
- 2 1/2 cups of sifted all-purpose flour

*** Instructions
- Sift the flower into a bowl and salt
- Add half the shortening and mix
- Add the rest of the shortening and finish mixing
- add a little of the cold water at a time kind of poking with a fork

The Key to making a crust is to not make an actual dough the crust needs to remain flaky.
This does make the crust harder to work with. but makes a better crust.
